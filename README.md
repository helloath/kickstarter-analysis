The month that launched the most successful Kickstarter campaigns was May. Successful launch outcomes also occurred in June, July, and August.

However, these months all had roughly the same number of failed campaigns launched.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

Plays that had a goal of less than $1,000 had the highest percentage of success. 

Plays that had a goal between $45,000 to $49,999 had the highest percentage of failure.  

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

I encountered a challenge when using the COUNTIFS() function to populate the columns. I used AskBCS Learning Assistant for help, and learned how to correctly use the COUNTIFS() function. 

## 3. Results

**- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?**

Launch Dates in May were had the highest amount of successful outcomes in Theater. 

Launch Dates in December had the lowest amount of successful outcomes in Theater.

**- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?**

Plays that had a goal of less than $1,000 had the lowest percentage of failure. 

Plays that had a goal between $1,000 and $4,999 had a high percentage of success. 

**- What are some limitations of this dataset?**

A limitation of this dataset is outcomes based on launch year.

**- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?**

Other possible tables and/or graphs that could be created could provide detail specific to year or country.
